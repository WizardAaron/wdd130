    <p>
        I'm Ethan Seth Long, a Service Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ
        of Latter-Day Saints! I enjoy playing video games with my friends, and
        keeping my brain active. I am currently working on a degree in Software
        Development. I almost always try to see things in a positive light, and
        am hopeful about what my future holds in store for me!

    <P>
      The United States of America is an amazing country where you have the freedom
      to believe and say what you want, and California has some of the nicest weather there.
